# INFO6150 Week 9 Assignments

Due by the beginning of class, week 10 (July 10).
You may revise up to 2 times by the beginning of class, week 11 (July 17).

This week you will be practicing adding an adaptive layout to your components from last week.

**You should finish all your week 8 revisions before starting the week 9 assignment**

## create a week-9 branch from your week-8 branch
You will be using the components you created last week for this week's assignment.

## add media queries
Create media queries for week 8's assignment to make it adaptive as well as responsive. You may add whatever breakpoints and flex/shuffle the layout as you like, but there must be at least 3 breakpoints and your layout must demonstrate good principles of usability. For example, think about readability in terms of line length, font sizes, etc. 

## start the webapp
