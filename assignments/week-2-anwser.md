Look and feel:
1. "Hierarchical":  
   
    As a shopping website, it's really important to show items in a centain order so that users can figure out what the website provides. This webiste shows its products in the order: "New arrivals" video, "Recommanded collections", "Shop by department", "Featured collection" and "New products", which are organized well. From the prespective of users, the new arrivals and recommanded collections are attractive and they are more likely to be kept within the website and browse more products. After that, they could be interested in shopping by department to get more ideas. And the least important parts "Featured collection" and 'New products' are put on the bottom to help to increase the chance that users find products they like.

2. "Concise":  
    
    This website is a good example of concise design. The white color tone accentuates colorful products, which makes users put more focus on the products. In addition, the grid layout and repetitive pictures make this website consistent, so that users can easily find relevant contents.

3. “High-quality”:
   
   The website is full of high-quality pictures and videos. It gives users a sense that products are also high-quality and reliable. It gives an emphasis on the visual descriptions instead of verbal descriptioins, which is a kind of contrast & emphasis. For the shopping website, users are tend to be attracted by pictures but not words. Thus, the high-quality pictures and videos make this website achieve good visual effects.
