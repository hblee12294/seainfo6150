# Week 1

### Usable website: *Pinterest*

1. Well designed. It has clear and concise UI designs, which help us to keep eye on website contents. Almost all elements show visual effects when they are hovered or activated.
2. Actions are intuitive, no cost of learning for users. For example,  'pin' a picture just need you to hover it, choose a board, and click big red 'save' button, without any redundancy actions or navigations.
3. It provides good explanation and tips. For example, when user click feedback icon, ambiguous actions have short sentences to explain what they are for. In addition, loading and error pages tell us what is happening.
4. It is navigable. Navigation bar are on the top of the screen, and its hierarchy is pretty flat. Thus users can always go back or jump to anther page.
5. It is adaptive to all kinds of devices with almost prefect visual effects.

### Not usable: *My Homepage* ( hongbinli.com )

It's a website to show my experience and works. But it's actually really hard to use.

1. No titles or explanations for every sections. Users don't know what I'm showing. They are just come out of nowhere.
2. It is less responsive. Images sometimes are too large on big screens like Macbook Pro(15''), and too small for mobile phones.
3. Contents are confusing and meaningless. I am pretty sure that after viewing them, people cannot get what are the highlights of my works and why I want to show them. In addition, I don't know what is the meaning of putting a 3D cube when I made this webiste.
4. Actions are not findable. Few people can tell that some of the work titles are clickable.
5. It is not navigable at all. No url changes, no anchors.


### Accessible: *Facebook*

1. 'tab' key and keybindings are really useful. Users can do most of things just with the keyboad. For example, when you click 'option' + '/', you can turn on the accessibility menu bar which provides shortcuts and keybindings explanations.
2. It supports screen readers.
3. The brand color - blue is friendly to people with color weakness.
4. Images has the 'alt' attribute to describe its content.
5. It's for everyone to use. For example, it provides all language options.

### Not accessible: *National Weather Service* ( https://www.weather.gov/ )

1. Bad page title. For example, the page 'Safety' express nothing. Users cannot get what is this 'Safety' like is it for safety annoucemounts or for safety tips.
2. No image 'alt' text.
3. Too many colors on the pages and they are even not consistant on each page.
4. Font size is too small, just 13 pixels.
5. Disordered page structure. It is not easy to find useful information without any headings or content sections.
6. Just default html links provides tab functions, no other optimizations.
